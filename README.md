Privacy Toolkit
==============

A toolkit for encrypted  communications, file storage and sharing.

There are several places and ways that data might be communicated, stored, shared, or used. You might wish to encrypt your data or communications in order to limit who else has access. 

## Phone-based communications ##

It's worth noting that *mobile-based communications is NOT secure.* The chips and access to your phone's capabilities are embedded deep enough that our apps can't protect us. If you want to give some of these applications a try, they're good starts--as long as you remember that access to underlying technologies lies with your phone providers.

[WhisperSystems RedPhone](https://whispersystems.org/) gives you the opportunity to use end-to-end encryption for your calls, but functions just like you're used to.

[WhisperSystems TextSecure](https://whispersystems.org/) "encrypts your text messages over the air and on your phone. It's almost identical to the normal text messaging application, and is just as easy to use."

## Chat ##

[Mumble](https://mumble.sourceforge.net/) is server and client chat software that encrypts voice communication. It's low-latency and is ideal for gamers.  

[unhosted](https://unhosted.org) and [RemoteStorage](http://remotestorage.io/) -
    
## Email ##

[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) and [Mac  GPG](https://gpgtools.org/) offer secure communication through encryption of data and digital signatures.

[Mailvelope](http://www.mailvelope.com/) uses the OpenPGP encryption standard which makes it compatible to existing mail encryption solutions.

## Secure Browsing ##

[EFF's HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) is a communications protocol for secure in-browser communication.

[TOR - The Onion Router](https://www.torproject.org/) - free software, open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security.


## File Storage & sharing across devices ##

[BTsync](http://www.bittorrent.com/sync/downloads) "Secure, unlimited file-syncing. No cloud required." [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=044jIZfnyqQ)

[EncFS](http://www.arg0.net/encfs) provides an encrypted filesystem that requiring no special permissions. You can use EncFS to encrypt a folder then store it in Dropbox or another remote shared facility.

[SpiderOak](http://spideroak.com) is used for private online backup, sync and sharing across devices.
